					<h2> Biography </h2>
					
					<p> Wanda Maximoff was born in 1989 in Sokovia to Oleg and Iryna Maximoff along with her twin brother, Pietro. Both children were born with abilities that were later developed, harnessed and honed by themselves, as well as HYDRA and later the Avengers.
<br>
Wanda known as the Scarlet Witch, and her brother Quicksilver (has the ability to move at superhuman speed) lost their parents at the age of 10 during violent bombings in Sokovia. As their home crumbled under bombs, the name “Stark Industries” became engraved in their minds as they were on the bomb shells. 
<br>
Thus began their quest for revenge for their parents and their home. Deceived by their perceptions, the siblings joined HYDRA, who were behind the bombings, in order to team up and defeat the Avengers with their amazing abilities. Wanda was skeptical, but was convinced by her brother.
<br>
During this time they developed their powers, Pietro his superhuman speed, and Wanda her psionic abilities, unlocked by exposure to the Scepter, one of the many tools used to test their abilities.
<br>
In a fight agains the Avengers, Wanda was able to use her powers on Tony Stark to control his mind, and it was revealed to her that his greatest fear was the global destruction of humanity. This struck a chord in her and she let him go, much to her brother’s protest.
<br>
In later years, Wanda would team up with the Avengers to use her powers for good. Losing her brother in the process, she connects with Vision and their love story begins.</p>
